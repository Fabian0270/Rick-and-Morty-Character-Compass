This project showcases a simple web app that fetches and displays characters from the Rick and Morty API. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to present character information including their image, name, status, and species in a visually appealing card format. The app dynamically generates content and updates in real-time by leveraging fetch API to obtain character details.
